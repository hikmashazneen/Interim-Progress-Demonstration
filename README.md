# A Personalised Data-Driven Approach to Predicting Brain Tumour Survivability in Adult Patients in Sri Lanka

## About
This project aims to develop a **data-driven, machine learning-based system** to predict the survivability of adult brain tumour patients in Sri Lanka. Using clinical, demographic, and histopathological data collected between 2018 and 2022, the project applies **survival analysis models**—including Cox Proportional Hazards, Random Survival Forest, and Accelerated Failure Time models—to estimate patient survival in months.  

An interactive **web-based dashboard**, developed using Streamlit, allows users to explore predictions and risk stratifications, in an interpretable and user-friendly format.

The goal of this project is to provide clinicians and researchers with a reliable tool to better understand survivability patterns and improve patient care through evidence-based insights.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline for structured clinical data  
- Survival analysis using multiple machine learning models  
- Risk stratification  
- Interactive dashboard for visualisation and exploration  

## Dataset
The dataset used is not included. It contains anonymised records of Sri Lankan brain tumour patients (2018–2022).
